# GameDesign-X-GameDevelopment - Simple Shooter

Developing games like Simple Shooter, where we are a fully animated third person character having
functionalities like movements, aiming systems, shooting mechanics with possible effects and
death mechanics.

Enemy AIs were also created having methods like hunting mechanics, following systems, shoot on
sight mechanics. The game ends when either our character or all enemy AIs have been killed.

Proper implementation of DSA and OOPs concepts were done for various functionalities of the game like movement-aiming functions, camera spring arm, inverse transforming vectors, line trace, blending
animations by booleans, enemy AIs and their functionalities, behaviour trees and blackboards.
